## Project goal and information
The goal of this project is to recreate the Discover UI in Shazam (which I think is a great, fun way to display content) in combination with a Tinder style of swiping cards to the left/right.
The idea behind this is that in some cases, you don't want to swipe away cards, but keep them availible for later on. This implementation allows for that. And it's a fun way to interact with content.

It's built with a `UICollectionView` and a custom flowLayout. This way, it works exactly the same as a normal `UICollectionView`.

## Todo
- [x] Implement Shazam Discover UI with paging
- [x] Implement Tinder-style swiping (still buggy)
- [x] Add the possibility to disable side swiping
- [ ] Turn project into an easy-to-use library
- [ ] Add code documentation in README.md file
- [ ] Add CocoaPods support 
- [ ] Add Carthage support
